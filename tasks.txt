Full stack Todo App

- Have users enter tasks into an HTML form (done)

- Those tasks will be stored on a database instead of localstorage (done)

- Develop an API with express (in progress)

- Fetch tasks with useEffect (done)
    - When user sends get request, how to fetch data from db?

- Continue to do more research about mongoose docs (in progress) 


Current technical problems

- Figure out a react key to use when mapping tasks
    - Can use index as key, but will cause problems with rendering
    - Ideally we want to get the ID from db

- Handle modifying tasks with event propagation or using inline handlers?
    - Might use inline for the sake of learning API/DB only
